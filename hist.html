                        and 11th centuries. As they were built by followers of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, they illustrate religious tolerance of the period when they were constructed. The largest temple is the Kailasa Temple (pictured), that is elaborately decorated with sculptures and paintings.[</p>
